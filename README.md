Chronometry
===========

A time travel based challenge pack. This pack will be heavily focused on adventure and technology. I plan to utilize Hardcore Questing Mode and Custom NPCs quite a bit.

You are a time agent being sent to various time periods to study and experiment. You do this from a safe location which is outside the normal effects of time and space. You can visit the Zones as many times as you want, the only catch is your items can’t go through the time portals. Each zone will have it’s own technology and challenges to overcome.
